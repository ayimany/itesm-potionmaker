# Potion Maker

The one and only original Potion Maker. This is a university project

## BUILDING THE PROJECT

If you are going to evaluate my project you probably care about this part the most.

### Method 1: Globbing or Manual

```
g++ -std=c++20 enemy_utils.cc entity.cc ingredient.cc ingredient_utils.cc menu_generation.cc potionmaker_game.cc status_effect.cc util.cc
```

### Method 2: CMake

I might as well marry CMake. If we're on the same page and you have CMake Installed, run:

## What is it?

Potion Maker is a small RPG turn-based game in which you fight a variety
of monsters by concocting potions. Each potion may be made up of one or more
ingredients, all of which have different effects and powers.

## Why?

Our assignment requires us to create a project in which we can apply the
principles of polymorphism. Although forced, they are present in this project.

## Under which circumstances does it not work?

If you don't wanna have fun, then it doesn't work. Apart from that, every
aspect of the game should be tightly controlled and errors shouldn't be leaking.
Can't say the same about memory though (Of course, I am joking).

Mmmh, standards
